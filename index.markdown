## Welcome ##
St Paul's is a parish of the Orthodox Church in America, in
the Diocese of the Midwest. We expect and welcome visitors and
inquirers, and look forward to the chance to introduce
ourselves to you!  

### Weekly Study Groups ###
The Sunday evening group (5 PM at the church) will be beginning to discuss
David Bell's book *Many Mansions: An Introduction to the Development and
Diversity of Medieval Theology* in mid January. Copies are now available from
Fr. Ted (cost is $23.) The Wednesday morning group (11 AM at the church)  is
reading Etienne Charpentier's *How To Read the New Testament*.

On Sunday mornings during Fellowship hour a group of those with a special
interest in raising children in the Orthodox Faith meets to share questions and
experiences, and is reading and discussing *Walking in Wonder: Nurturing
Orthodox Christian Values in Your Children*.

The Sunday evening group (5 PM at the church) is just finishing *A Cloud of
Witnesses* by David Bell, which surveys history and doctrine of the early
Christian church.

Those interested in a close reading of passages from each Sunday's Epistle
lessons are invited to the 10 Minute Study Group right after Liturgy. We
include some material from commentaries and look at a few relevant Greek words.

A new small group study of the materials from last winter's Called and Gifted
Workshop is just organizing. See Fr. Ted or Laura Short if you are interested.
